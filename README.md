# Molecular Toxicity Prediction using Graph Neural Networks

## Overview
This project implements a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to predict molecular toxicity from chemical structures.
Given a molecule represented as a SMILES string, the model converts it into a graph where atoms are nodes
and chemical bonds are edges, and predicts the probability of toxicity.

The goal of this project is to understand how graph-based deep learning models can be applied to
chemistry and drug discovery tasks.

## Dataset
- Dataset Name: Tox21
- Source: DeepChem
- Input: SMILES representation of molecules
- Output: Binary toxicity label (SR-ATAD5)

The dataset contains real-world chemical compounds annotated with toxicity-related biological responses.

## Methodology

### 1. Molecular Graph Construction
- SMILES strings are parsed using RDKit
- Atoms are represented as nodes using one-hot encoded features
- Chemical bonds are represented as edges in the graph

### 2. Model Architecture
- Two Graph Convolutional (GCN) layers
- ReLU activation functions
- Flattening of node embeddings into a fixed-size vector
- Two fully connected (linear) layers
- Sigmoid activation for probability output

### 3. Training
- Loss Function: Binary Cross Entropy Loss (BCELoss)
- Optimizer: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
- Class imbalance handled using oversampling of the minority class

## Training the Model
- To train the model on the Tox21 dataset:
- python train.py
- This script loads the dataset, balances the classes, trains the GNN model, and saves the trained weights.
## Running Inference
- After training, you can test the model using the command-line interface:
- python test_model_cli.py
- You will be prompted to enter a SMILES string, and the model will output the predicted toxicity probability.

## Limitations

- Fixed maximum number of atoms per molecule
- Limited atom feature representation
- No explicit edge features
- No global pooling mechanism
- Training performed without batching

## Future Improvements

- Replace flattening with global pooling
- Use advanced GNN layers such as GAT or GIN
- Add ROC-AUC evaluation metric
- Improve atom and bond feature representations
- Enable GPU acceleration and mini-batch training
